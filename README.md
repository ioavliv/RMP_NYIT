# Rate My NYIT Professor

## About

  RateMyProfessor is a review site used by students to anonymously leave feedback about
their professors. The app we are developing is very similar to the popular website, the only
difference is that it will be tailored to NYIT student’s experience. NYIT has a small campus
located in Manhattan so small, that professors often teach multiple courses within the campus.
Because of this there are usually inconsistent or little to no ratings of NYIT’s professors on
RateMyProfessor’s website. With the low presence of reviews for NYIT’s professors, it makes it
harder for students to navigate the process of choosing the right professor for them. At NYIT
student’s would have to wait until the first day of fall or spring semester to understand how the
course would run for the semester. Student’s have the option to change their professor during the
add/drop period however, by that time professors have already begun teaching the course leaving
students who do switch professors to fall behind during the beginning of the semester.

  The app we are developing would decrease all the stress and fears that goes into selecting
courses to take for the next semester. Using android software students would be able to give a
rating, provide the course ID, as well as leave a comment for future students to read. It would
also organize each course by a list of professors and their ratings. Overall, our RateMyProfessor
app is for NYIT students, by NYIT students, allowing us to make it easier in choosing the right
professor.
